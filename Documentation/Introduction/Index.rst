The TYPO3-Extension **Address Management (EXT: addressmgmt)** was created to *replace tt_address*.

It is used to display persons, organisations or locations as lists or on a map. It provides also a connection to FE User in order to add/edit address records in the frontend. You can visit the `demo website <https://addressmgmt-eventmgmt.dev.undkonsorten.com>`_ here.
